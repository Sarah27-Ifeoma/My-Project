# Library Management System - UML and Implementation

This repository contains a **Library Management System**, including a UML **Use Case Diagram** and JavaScript code implementation. The project demonstrates the principles of object-oriented programming and basic UML modeling.

## Features

- **Member Functionalities**:
  - Search for books in the catalog.
  - Borrow books.
  - Return borrowed books.
- **Librarian Functionalities**:
  - Manage books in the library collection (add and remove books).

## UML Use Case Diagram

The system's functionalities and interactions are represented in a **UML Use Case Diagram**, modeled using [Draw.io](https://draw.io).

### Actors:
- **Member**: Can search, borrow, and return books.
- **Librarian**: Manages the library's book collection.
